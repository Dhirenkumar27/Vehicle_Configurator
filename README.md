# Vehicle_Configurator
Vehicle Configurator Project
Project Description:

Vehicle Configurator (V-CONF) is a web-based B2B portal developed using Spring Boot 3 in a microservices architecture. The platform enables rental car companies to configure and purchase vehicles based on their requirements. Key features include segment-wise vehicle selection, manufacturer and model filtering, default and custom vehicle configuration (interior/exterior), accessory selection, and quantity validation. The system generates invoice PDFs and emails them to customers. It uses MySQL 8 with JPA, JWT-based security, Spring Profiles, Docker for containerization, RestTemplate for inter-service communication, AOP for logging, and Mockito for testing.
